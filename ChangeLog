	* Added LIBKSNMP_VERSION macro for test for version of library for
	  future backward compatibility for software.
	* Added SNMPver enum to define the version of SNMP protocol to use
	  (imported from KNetLoad).
	* Added createSession() commodity function to create a session without
	  need to check for version to use.
	* Fixed tests to compile on some configurations in which uint32_t is
	  not defined.
	* Cleanup of configure checks for net-snmp, now should work better.
