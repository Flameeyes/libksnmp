libksnmp 0.1
Copyright (c) 2004-2005 Diego "Flameeyes" Pettenò

This library was initially wrote for my ATMOSphere project
(http://atmosphere.sourceforge.net/) to simplify access ot SNMP statistics
for routers compliant with this protocol.

It's just a wrapper around net-snmp, which does all the dirt work in a C way.
Also, this library is useful to avoid hacking around net-snmp "bugs" (or
"features") with autoconf headers.

At the moment libksnmp can be used to access v1 and v2c compatible devices,
in readonly way, with a simplified access to RFC1213-compliant devices.

For information on use of the library, please generate the doxygen apidoc, and
read it.

This is an experimental library for now, every contribution is well accepted,
if you want a CVS access to hack around, just contact me.

About the tests in the tests/ subdirectory, they are testcases I created to
verify some conditions which led me into trouble when working with libksnmp.
They should work, someway, but they are surely something you don't need too
much. See them for example on how to use the library, anyway.
